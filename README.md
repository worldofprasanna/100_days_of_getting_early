# 100_days_of_getting_early
Track my activities after getting up at 5:15 AM

I want to form the habit of getting up early for long time. And for the past one week, I have been getting up between 5:15 - 5:30 AM regularly. So thought of tracking my time spent in the morning 1.5 hours and see after 100 days what I can achieve.
